## Build Error Resolution - Compose Cleanup

### Problem:
The project was originally created with Compose but we converted it to use XML layouts. However, Compose theme files were still present causing compilation errors:
- Color.kt - Trying to import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color
- Theme.kt - Trying to import Compose theme functions
- Type.kt - Trying to import Compose typography

### Solution Applied:

1. **Removed Compose theme files**:
   - Deleted Color.kt, Theme.kt, Type.kt from ui/theme folder
   - Removed entire ui folder since it's not needed for XML layouts

2. **Updated build.gradle.kts**:
   - Removed `alias(libs.plugins.kotlin.compose)` plugin
   - Kept only Android and Kotlin plugins needed for XML layouts

3. **Verified clean state**:
   - MainActivity.kt - No Compose imports
   - LoadingActivity.kt - Clean AppCompatActivity
   - SignupActivity.kt - Clean AppCompatActivity
   - All XML layouts - Using standard Android views

### Current Project Structure:
```
app/
├── src/main/
│   ├── java/com/bilalshakeel/i210575/
│   │   ├── MainActivity.kt ✓
│   │   ├── LoadingActivity.kt ✓
│   │   └── SignupActivity.kt ✓
│   ├── res/
│   │   ├── layout/
│   │   │   ├── activity_loading.xml ✓
│   │   │   └── activity_signup.xml ✓
│   │   ├── drawable/ (all valid drawables) ✓
│   │   └── values/ (colors, strings, themes) ✓
│   └── AndroidManifest.xml ✓
```

### Status: 
✅ **Ready to build** - All Compose references removed, project uses pure XML layouts

The project should now compile successfully without any "Unresolved reference 'compose'" errors.
